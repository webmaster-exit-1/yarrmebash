# Yarr Me Bash is a complete Linux bash shell prompt configuration and theme for Linux

* The files included are the .bashrc, starship.toml + a few wallpapers.
* Just run the install.sh and let the script do the rest.

## Installation

* Try with `sudo` ;)

```bash
./install.sh
```
   or try
```
bash install.sh
```
* Please note: the bashrc has lsd aliased to ls and bat aliased to cat. So please go over the bashrc file and comment in/out what works for you before installing.
* Once finished. If any issues are present, just comment stuff out in the new .bashrc, feh might not set wallpapers correctly, do this manually.
* Also depending on the terminal you use, please set the font in the terminal settings. I preffer GoMono Nerd Font. Monospaced fonts have smaller icons.
* And don't forget to source your new .bashrc. Or logout and log back in.
```bash
. .bashrc
```
